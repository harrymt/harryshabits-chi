#### Abstract
Habit formation technologies use rewards and points as means for providing positive reinforcement, often in the format of visual or audio rewards such as jingles, badges or animations. Providing the right reward increases the chances for developing a new habit; yet, research on how these rewards should be delivered and the impact that this has on the process of habit formation is scarce. In this paper we investigate how three types of positive reinforcement (audio, visual, audio-visual) influence habit completion and automaticity. We describe a 4-week study in which participants used a chatbot that delivered different types of rewards for completing a new daily habit. The results reported higher habit completion rates when a reward was present, especially for the visual condition, without necessarily increasing behaviour automaticity. This has implications for the design of habit formation technologies that rely on audio and visual rewards as means of positive reinforcement.
